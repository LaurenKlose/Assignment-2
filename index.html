			<p><font size= "6">Hello, my name is Lauren Klose and I have been a bookseller at Barnes & Noble for the past five years! That's me to the right, dressed up for the 50's Throwback Thursday even this past summer of 2015 for our "Get Pop Cultured" event! Most people think that working at a bookstore is very romantic.That us booksellers just get to read all day and deal with highly sophsticated and lovely people. This image is a far cry from what it actually is like to work at a bookstore.When I first started working at Barnes & Noble five years ago, the manager that hired me described it as a duck on a lake, all calm and collected on the surface but underneathe paddling like mad to stay afloat.</font></p>

			<p><font size="6">In reality we do not just sit around in read (we are actually not allowed to read while at work) but rather constantly running around doing projects in between helping customers.These include setting up tables, endcaps and even overnight or early morning relays where we move around sections of books to cycle out old titles to make room for new ones (such as the one pictures on the right).</font></p>

			<p><font size="6">Speaking of customers...they aren't always the greatest. Sometimes they leave us messes to find that are a bit ridiculous in size or laziness. Other times we are left to find some truely weird or amusing things though some of those could be other bookseller's doings or just simple accidents and moments of irony. </font></p>

			<p><font size= "6">In the end though, working there is pretty great. The discounts and perks are pretty awesome, we get 30% off of almost everything except music/dvd's where we get 20%! The cafe, which sadly the one I currently work at doesn't have, we get 50% off! In addition to the benefits what is also great is getting a great second family (even if my little sister is a part of that to now!) All in all I am happy to say that I am a member of the Barnes and Noble family and wouldn't have it any other way! </font></p>
