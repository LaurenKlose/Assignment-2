			<p>Most people think that working at a bookstore is very romantic. That us booksellers just get to read all day and deal with highly sophsticated and lovely people. This image is a far cry from what it actually is like to work at a bookstore. When I first started working at Barnes & Noble five years ago, the manager that hired me described it as a duck on a lake, all calm and collected on the surface but underneathe paddling like mad to stay afloat.</p>

			<p>In reality we do not just sit around in read (we are actually not allowed to read while at work) but rather constantly running around doing projects in between helping customers.</p>

			<p>Speaking of customers...they aren't always the greatest. Sometimes they leave us messes to find that are a bit ridiculous in size or laziness. Other times we are left to find some truely weird or amusing things though some of those could be other bookseller's doings or just simple accidents and moments of irony.</p>

			<p>In the end though, working there is pretty great. The discounts and perks are pretty awesome and so is getting a great second family (even if my little sister is a part of that to now!) Plus we get some pretty amazing views of sunsets from the cash registers!</p>

			<p>All in all I am happy to say that I am a memember of the Barnes and Noble family and wouldn't have it any other way!</p>
